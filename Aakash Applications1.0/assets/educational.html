<p><strong><h2>Educational Content </h2></strong></p>
<p align="justify">Apart from  displaying text files in various formats, Aakash can play video and audio  content. The content can be either on a local Micro SD card  storage or on a server accessible through Wi-Fi. A lot of contents are  available through efforts such as NPTEL, Spoken Tutorials, Workshop courses, etc.  Wikipedia, Gutenberg project, Connexions project at Rice University,  and many such global efforts have generated a large pool of knowledge contents  in Open Source.</p>
<p align="justify">The efforts at IIT  Bombay have been to add more such contents for use in Indian education system, to  integrate these together in a better usable format, and to make these  accessible using Aakash.</p>
<p>This application  accesses such contents, located on an SD card, in .pdf, .html, or .mp3 formats.</p>
